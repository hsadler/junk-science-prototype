X Basic 3D first-person environment

- POC reactions:
    X water mix with salt makes saline
    X water heated makes steam
    X saline heated makes steam and salt
    - steam cooled makes water
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- Experiment with Unity sphere objects as "elements":
    X scale for max amount in a scene
    X elements affected by an outside force:
        X element-to-element contact (chemical reactions)
        X heat
    - element "state" behaviors:
        - solid
        - liquid
        - gas

- Elements to create:
    - water
    - salt
    - saline
    - steam
