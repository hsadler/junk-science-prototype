X Basic 3D first-person environment

X Elements to create:
    X water
    X salt
    X saline
    X steam

X element "state" behaviors:
    X liquid
    X gas

X POC reactions:
    X water mix with salt makes saline
    X water heated makes steam
    X saline heated makes steam and salt
    X steam cooled makes water

X eng & bugs pass:
    X fix spawn-count and FPS tracking
    X add reticle for first-person player with esc key toggle

X take more videos

- focus on player experience:
    X SE size relative to player
    X player pick-up object
    X lab environment:
        X room
        X tables
        X lights
    - lab equipment:
        X science-element dispenser:
            X design
            X create/destroy science-elements
            X physical button for element type and on/off
        X beaker:
            X sizes:
                X small
                X medium

            X behavior:
                X pickup
                X carry
                X drop

            X design:
                X plate
                X button
            X behavior:
                X button press does on/off
                X placement of beaker + turn on locks beaker and mixes contents
                X refinements
        X heater
            X design
            X behavior
        - cooler

refine UX:
    X beaker 3d model design in Blender
    https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-blender-3d-modeling-for-unity-video-game-development/
    X player pick-up, transfer, and dump beakers
    - walk mode for player when shift is pressed
    - play with change of SE sizes, colliders, and shapes

- bugs:
    - buggy physical-button interaction
    - saline not turning to steam and salt in lab scene
    - cannot pick-up beaker when heater is on

- prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - fills container with salt
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    - takes beaker to heater
    - heats saline to produce steam and salt
    

/////// defer ///////

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid

- more POC reactions:
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- more prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
