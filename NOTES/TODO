X Basic 3D first-person environment

X Elements to create:
    X water
    X salt
    X saline
    X steam

- play with change of SE sizes, colliders, and shapes

- element "state" behaviors:
    - solid
    X liquid
    X gas

- POC reactions:
    X water mix with salt makes saline
    X water heated makes steam
    X saline heated makes steam and salt
    X steam cooled makes water
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - fills container with salt
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    - takes beaker to heater
    - heats saline to produce steam and salt
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
