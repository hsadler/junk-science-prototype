TODO

- polish:
    X tweak molten metal to be more yellow and glow more than lava
    X all saline collision based reactions should produce the same effect as 
        water (plus a salt by-product)
    - tweak heat min and max to be a smaller window
    - do heat checks more often and with a smaller heat change (basically higher granularity)
    - make base elements have starting heat
    - LIGHTING PASS!

- bugs:
    - finish game display is appearing on top of last element discovery display
        (not happening, may be intermittent)
    - not all heat changes are taking effect

- music and sfx

- take more videos


/////// defer ///////

- bugs:

- refine UX:
    - try images for science elements instead of color texture
    - destroy science-elements when they hit the floor or ceiling
    - ability to pickup science element for inspection
    - show what items have been discovered
    - add button for cooler on/off
    - rage throw
    - rage table flip
    - beakers break when dropped

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid
