X Basic 3D first-person environment

X Elements to create:
    X water
    X salt
    X saline
    X steam

X element "state" behaviors:
    X liquid
    X gas

X POC reactions:
    X water mix with salt makes saline
    X water heated makes steam
    X saline heated makes steam and salt
    X steam cooled makes water

X eng & bugs pass:
    X fix spawn-count and FPS tracking
    X add reticle for first-person player with esc key toggle

- take more videos

- focus on player experience:
    X SE size relative to player
    X player pick-up object
    X lab environment:
        X room
        X tables
        X lights
    - lab equipment:
        - science-element dispenser:
            X design
            X create/destroy science-elements
            - physical button for element type and on/off
        - beaker dispenser
            - design
            - create beaker with push of button

refine UX:
    - beaker 3d model design in Blender
    https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-blender-3d-modeling-for-unity-video-game-development/
    - player pick-up, transfer, and dump beakers
    - play with change of SE sizes, colliders, and shapes

- prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - fills container with salt
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    - takes beaker to heater
    - heats saline to produce steam and salt
    

/////// defer ///////

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid

- more POC reactions:
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- more prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
