- refine UX:
    X show element type and info display on element hover
    - show element display name instead of tag on element hover
    - toy around with meshes for science element distinction
    - toy around with physical materials for science element distinction
    - (maybe) ability to pickup science element for inspection
    - (maybe) show what items have been discovered
    - (maybe) add button for cooler on/off

- music and sfx

- polish

- bugs:

- take more videos

- last minute features (for fun):
    - rage throw
    - rage table flip
    - beakers break when dropped


/////// defer ///////

- bugs:
    - buggy physical-button interaction (only on iOS?)

- refine UX:
