X prototype UX:
    X fills container with water
    X transfers container to beaker and dumps
    X fills container with salt
    X transfers container to beaker and dumps
    X mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    X takes beaker to heater
    X heats saline to produce steam and salt
    X cool steam to produce water

- add more science elements:
    - earth
    - mud
    - stone
    - ore
    - slag
    - molten metal
    - metal
    - lava
    - clay
    - brick

- refine UX:
    - (maybe) show element type and info display on element hover

- take more videos

- bugs:

- last minute features (for fun):
    - rage throw
    - rage table flip
    - beakers break when dropped


/////// defer ///////

- bugs:
    - buggy physical-button interaction (only on iOS?)

- refine UX:
    
    - try images for science elements instead of color texture
    - add upper bound and lower bounds for heat of elements 
        (so that water isn't allowed to be less than freezing, for instance)
    - destroy science-elements when they hit the floor or ceiling
    - lower max amount of science elements in global pool to 3k

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid

- more POC reactions:
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- more prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
