X prototype UX:
    X fills container with water
    X transfers container to beaker and dumps
    X fills container with salt
    X transfers container to beaker and dumps
    X mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    X takes beaker to heater
    X heats saline to produce steam and salt
    X cool steam to produce water

- refactor heater: put a shelf above which beakers can be placed on but the elements fall through
- refactor cooler: add a shelf for beaker which elements pass through

- take more videos

refine UX:
    X beaker 3d model design in Blender
    https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-blender-3d-modeling-for-unity-video-game-development/
    X player pick-up, transfer, and dump beakers
    - walk mode for player when shift is pressed
    - add upper bound and lower bounds for heat of elements 
        (so that water isn't allowed to be less than freezing, for instance)
    - play with change of SE sizes, colliders, and shapes

- bugs:
    - buggy physical-button interaction (only on iOS?)
    - saline not turning to steam and salt in lab scene
    X cannot pick-up beaker when heater is on

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid

- more POC reactions:
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- more prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
