X Basic 3D first-person environment

X Elements to create:
    X water
    X salt
    X saline
    X steam

X element "state" behaviors:
    X liquid
    X gas

X POC reactions:
    X water mix with salt makes saline
    X water heated makes steam
    X saline heated makes steam and salt
    X steam cooled makes water

- eng & bugs pass:
    X fix spawn-count and FPS tracking
    - add reticle for first-person player with esc key toggle

- take more videos

- focus on player experience:
    X SE size relative to player
    - player pick-up, transfer, and dump beakers
    - lab environment
    - lab equipment:
        - SE despenser
        - beaker
        - mixer
        - heater
        - cooler

- play with change of SE sizes, colliders, and shapes

- prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - fills container with salt
    - transfers container to beaker and dumps
    - mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    - takes beaker to heater
    - heats saline to produce steam and salt
    

/////// defer ///////

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid

- more POC reactions:
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- more prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
