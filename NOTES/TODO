X prototype UX:
    X fills container with water
    X transfers container to beaker and dumps
    X fills container with salt
    X transfers container to beaker and dumps
    X mixes contents in beaker to produce saline
    X takes beaker to heater
    X heats saline to produce steam and salt
    X cool steam to produce water

- add more science elements:
    - earth
    - mud
    - stone
    - ore
    - slag
    - molten metal
    - metal
    - lava
    - clay
    - brick

- eng:
    X add min/max heat to elements
    X add collision and heat-change handlers for new science elements:
        X collisions:
            X water + salt = saline
            X lava + water = stone & steam
            X water + earth = 70% mud, 20% stone, 10% ore
        X heat:
            X boil water = steam
            X melt earth = lava
            X boil saline = steam & salt
            X cool steam = water
            X cool lava = stone
            X cool mud = clay
            X heat mud = earth
            X heat clay = brick & steam
            X heat ore = slag & molten metal
            X cool molten metal = metal

- refine UX:
    - toy around with meshes for science element distinction
    - toy around with physical materials for science element distinction
    - add message when all discoveries have been made
    - hide cursor immediately (only allow esc->cursor show in editor)
    - add button for cooler on/off
    - add reset scene ability
    - add controls instructions
    - (maybe) show element type and info display on element hover

- take more videos

- bugs:

- last minute features (for fun):
    - rage throw
    - rage table flip
    - beakers break when dropped


/////// defer ///////

- bugs:
    - buggy physical-button interaction (only on iOS?)

- refine UX:
    
    - try images for science elements instead of color texture
    - add upper bound and lower bounds for heat of elements 
        (so that water isn't allowed to be less than freezing, for instance)
    - destroy science-elements when they hit the floor or ceiling
    - lower max amount of science elements in global pool to 3k

- more element "state" behaviors:
    - solid

- more POC reactions:
    - water cooled makes ice
    - saline cooled makes iceberg

- more prototype UX:
    - fills container with water
    - tranfers to cooler
    - produces ice
